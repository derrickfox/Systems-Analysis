PERSONAL TRAINER, INC.</h3>

Personal Trainer, Inc., owns and operates fitness centers in a dozen midwestern 
cities. The centers have done well, and the company is planning an international 
expansion by opening a new &quot;supercenter&quot; in the Toronto area. Personal Trainer's 
president, Cassia Umi, hired an IT consultant, Susan Park, to help develop an 
information system for the new facility. During the project, Susan will work 
closely with Gray Lewis, who will manage the new operation.</p>

Background</h4>

At their initial meeting, Susan and Gray discussed some initial steps in 
planning a new information system for the new facility. The next morning, they 
worked together on a business profile, drew an organization chart, discussed 
feasibility issues, and talked about various types of information systems that 
would provide the best support for the supercenter's operations. Their main 
objective was to carry out a preliminary investigation of the new system and 
report their recommendations to Personal Trainer's top managers. After the 
working session with Gray, Susan returned to her office and reviewed her notes. 
She knew that Personal Trainer's president, Cassia Umi, wanted the supercenter 
to become a model for the company's future growth, but she did not remember any 
mention of an overall strategic plan for the company. Susan also wondered 
whether the firm had done a SWOT analysis or analyzed the internal and external 
factors that might affect an information system for the supercenter.Because the 
new operation would be so important to the company, Susan believed that Personal 
Trainer should consider an enterprise resource planning strategy that could 
provide a company-wide framework for information management. After she finished 
compiling her notes, Susan listed several topics that might need more study and 
called Gray to arrange another meeting the following day.</p>
